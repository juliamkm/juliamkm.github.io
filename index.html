                <h3>Ten Essentials to Bring</h3>
                    <p>When planning a backpacking trip, it can be handy to remember the "Ten Essentials." This includes navigation, headlamp,
                    sun protection, first aid, knife, fire &#40;includes matches, lighter, tinder and/or stove&#41; shelter, extra food, and extra water.</p>
                <h3>Further Considerations</h3>
                    <p>You will also want to take into consideration the weather forecast when planning for your trip. Cooler temperatures call for warmer layers, 
                    extra calories, and more fuel to cook and heat water.<br> Warmer temps mean staying covered from the sun, packing extra water, and being cautious of heat-related illness</p>
